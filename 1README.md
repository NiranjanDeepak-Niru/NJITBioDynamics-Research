This Repository contains the Python Program which Analyzes the OPENSIM Data and graphs it.
Through these graphs can analyze motion of human with the exoskeleton, activation energies, different forces, and much more.
Helps understand the effect of an exoskeleton on the human motion.

Graph Files Uploaded to this Repository.
Contains Graphs of CASE 3 Negative Torque for bidirectional movement simulation using different levels of exoskeleton assistance.

#Contains Python Program & Graphs
